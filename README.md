# What is React.Fragment and What is Empty Fragment?

1. Fragment:- A wrapper component that lets you group multiple elements without adding an extra DOM node to the HTML output. 

2. Empty Fragment:- A shorthand syntax for React.Fragment that does the same thing — groups elements without extra DOM nodes — but doesn't support the key prop.

Note:- we can not write id and className attribute in both fragment.
